HUMAN: what is leave
AI: Leave, in the context of NHLML's policy, refers to the authorized absence from work granted to executives for various reasons as outlined in the NHLML Executive Leave Rules. There are different types of leave, including:

- **Casual Leave**: Allowed for personal reasons for up to 8 days in a calendar year, which can be taken in full or half-day increments.
- **Earned Leave (EL)**: Accumulated based on service, with a maximum entitlement of 30 days per year, 15 days credited twice a year (on January 1st and July 1st), requiring at least 10 days to be taken annually, with a carry-over limit of 20 days to the next year.
- **Extra-Ordinary Leave (EOL) / Special Leave**: Granted in special circumstances, often without pay, for durations varying from up to 3 months to up to 18 months depending on the reason, such as illness or disability.
- **Special Disability Leave**: Provided for disabilities resulting from official duties or position, with a period determined by a medical board.

Leave must be sought and granted by the appropriate sanctioning authority, and its approval depends on the company's operational needs. Unauthorized absences beyond specified limits can lead to disciplinary actions as per company policy.

Bot: 
The term you're referring to seems to be a typographical variation of "leave." According to the NHLML Executive Leave Rules, "leave" is defined within the context of the periods during which executives are entitled to be away from their regular duties under specific conditions. The general purpose and definition of leave include:

- **Earning Leave:** Executives earn leave in accordance with the provisions detailed in the rules upon joining the company (1.3a).
- **Duty Obligation:** Except on declared Company Holidays, executives must either be on duty or on leave. Absence without sanctioned leave for more than 4 calendar days is considered misconduct and may result in losing lien and deemed separation from service (1.3b).
- **Management Discretion:** The grant, refusal, or cancellation of leave rests solely with the leaves sanctioning authority, based on the company's work exigencies (1.3e).
- **No Automatic Right:** Leave cannot be claimed as a matter of right but must be sought and granted by the appropriate authority (1.3d).

For detailed entitlements and types of leave (e.g., casual leave, earned leave), specific sections within the leave rules would need to be consulted, which are not fully detailed in the provided excerpt. If you need specifics on types of leave or entitlements, please let me know, and I can provide further based on typical HR practices aligned with the given framework.
